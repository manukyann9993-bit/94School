GUIDE: HOW TO EDIT PROJECTS (Նախագծեր)

LOCATION
The projects are located in the "script.js" file. Look for the variable named "projectsData".

FORMAT
Each project is inside curly braces { ... }. The format is:

    {
        id: NUMBER,             // Unique ID (1, 2, 3...). High numbers show first.
        title: "Title Here",    // The title on the card
        author: "Author Here",  // Class or Student Name
        year: "YEAR",           // Year
        summary: "Short Text",  // Short description on the card
        content: `              // The details inside the modal (HTML allowed)
            <h1>Big Title</h1>
            <p>Your long text goes here...</p>
        `
    },

HOW TO ADD A NEW PROJECT
1. Open script.js
2. Find "projectsData"
3. Copy one of the blocks starting from { and ending with },
4. Paste it at the BEGINNING of the list (inside the brackets [ ... ])
5. Change the ID to be one number higher than the previous highest ID.
6. Change the title, author, and content text.

HOW TO DELETE
Simply delete the block starting from { down to }, including the comma.

IMPORTANT
- Do not remove the backticks (`) around the content.
- Be careful with commas between items.
